# SQL-Wizard
SQL Wizard: Natural Language SQL Query Generator and Executor  SQL Wizard empowers users to effortlessly extract and execute SQL queries from databases using natural language commands. Transform your database interactions by simplifying complex SQL queries into easy-to-understand language.

Our app is designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex databases, allowing users to interact with databases through natural language. Leveraging the power of the Gemini API combined with the LangGraph framework, our app dynamically generates SQL queries from user inputs, making data retrieval as simple as asking a question in English.

We utilized different prompts within the LangGraph framework to handle various aspects of the query generation process, from understanding user intent to suggesting relevant tables and constructing accurate SQL queries. The app is built with a Flask-based GUI, providing a seamless and intuitive interface where users can input their queries, view generated SQL, and see the results all in one place.

By integrating the Gemini API, we ensured that our app can handle complex data structures and provide fast, accurate responses, making data analysis accessible to anyone, regardless of their SQL knowledge.
